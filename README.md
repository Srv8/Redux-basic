# To-do with Redux
> App is up running visit the link - https://redux-todo-v8.netlify.app/

This is not a complete CRUD application as we are just add and delete the items from the list.

This was made to understand the very basic structure of Redux store.

## How to run
- Clone the Repo
- Open the code in any code editor. ( I personally use Vs Code)
- Open up the terminal
- Run - npm install ( This will install all the required dependencies for the app)
- Run - npm start

And the application will launch on your localhost:3000

## Use
> This app will help you understand the basic operations of Redux store.
- Add
- Delete

## Notes
> The data is not being store not even in your local storage.

So if you refresh the page, everything will be reset.

I did not want to waste or allocate memory for something so basic.
